# Things to do

- [ ] Opcode structs
- [x] Bus struct
- [ ] 6052 struct
- [x] Make list of opcode encodings
- [ ] Make guide to hand assemble code
- [ ] Make tools to help development along:
    - [x] push script
    - [ ] assembler for 6502 assembly language


### Consider...
 - [ ] making a specific union for the crtl piece of the bus struct... this would allow ctrl to be addressed as bus.crtl.[pin_name] instead of bus.ctrl.bitX
